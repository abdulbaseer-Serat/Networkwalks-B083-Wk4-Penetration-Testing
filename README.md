## 1. 🎯 Executive Summary

An authorized **black-box penetration test** was conducted on Mediroza General Hospital's web infrastructure. The assessment identified seven security vulnerabilities ranging from Medium to Critical severity.

The most critical issue was a SQL injection vulnerability in the patient portal login page, allowing authentication bypass and unauthorized access to confidential patient records. Further exploitation exposed sensitive data, including patient lab reports, employee salary information, and shareholder details through a publicly accessible database backup.

Overall, the hospital's security posture is poor, with multiple vulnerabilities that could enable attackers to access sensitive medical, financial, and corporate information without authentication. Immediate remediation is recommended to reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.A controlled **black-box penetration test** was conducted against Mediroza General Hospital's web infrastructure as part of a Week 4 penetration testing internship assignment.

| 🌐 **Target** | `https://medirozahospital.com` |
| 🏢 **Client** | Mediroza General Hospital |
| 🧪 **Assessment Type** | Black-box Web Application Penetration Test |
| ✅ **Authorization** | Explicitly authorized, educational scope only |
| 🚫 **Excluded** | Social engineering, denial-of-service |

### Objectives

1. Gain access to the restricted patient portal
2. Retrieve three confidential patient laboratory reports
3. Crack the encryption protecting all three reports
4. Identify exposed employee salary information
5. Identify exposed shareholder information
6. Document vulnerabilities, evidence, impact, and remediation

### Key Findings

| ID | Finding | Severity |
|---|---|:---:|
| MED-01 | SQL Injection → Patient Portal Authentication Bypass | 🔴 **Critical** |
| MED-02 | Publicly Accessible Database Backup (HR & Shareholder Data) | 🔴 **Critical** |
| MED-03 | Weak PDF Passwords / Recoverable Encryption | 🟠 **High** |
| MED-04 | SQL Error Disclosure / Unsafe SQL Construction | 🟡 **Medium** |
| MED-05 | Username Enumeration via Auth Responses | 🟢 **Low** |
| MED-06 | Directory Listing / Information Disclosure | 🟢 **Low** |

> **Bottom line:** A username-field SQL injection bypassed patient login entirely, exposing three encrypted lab reports. All three were cracked offline with Hashcat. Separately, a forgotten backup at `/old/` leaked internal staff salary and shareholder records to the open internet — no authentication required.

## 🕵️ Attack Surface Discovery

**HTTP fingerprinting** revealed the server stack and CMS version (`LiteSpeed`, `PHP/8.2.33`, `Mediroza CMS 1.4.2`), providing reconnaissance value to an attacker.

**`robots.txt`** disallowed — and thereby advertised — three sensitive paths:

```
Disallow: /patient/
Disallow: /staff/
Disallow: /old/
```

`/old/` turned out to contain a fully exposed database backup — a reminder that `robots.txt` is a *suggestion to crawlers*, not an access control.

## 🐛 Findings

<details open>
<summary><strong>MED-01 · SQL Injection Authentication Bypass</strong> — 🔴 Critical</summary>

**Component:** `/patient/login.php`

The login form processed user input in a way that allowed SQL syntax manipulation. A crafted username using SQL comment syntax (`admin'--`) caused the application to bypass the password check entirely and redirect into the restricted patient portal at `/patient/portal.php`, exposing three lab report entries.

**Likely vulnerable construction:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM patients
WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
```
<img width="667" height="489" alt="evidencemed-01-sql-injection-error pn" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ca5a89b-35e7-48b5-80ef-e5b0eb005297" />
<img width="1600" height="876" alt="atient-portal-report-access png" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb98c67-c9d1-4258-aedc-eb99691b6d2a" />
<img width="1600" height="874" alt="pass found" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6277bd45-9506-40ef-873a-3669d37a51f3" />


**Remediation:** parameterized queries, secure password hashing (Argon2id/bcrypt), generic auth errors, rate limiting/lockout, suspicious-activity logging.

```php
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT id, password_hash FROM patients WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```
</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>MED-02 · Publicly Accessible Database Backup</strong> — 🔴 Critical</summary>

**Path:** `/old/mediroza_db_backup_2019.sql` — downloadable with no authentication.

Contained a `staff` table (name, title, department, email, phone, **national ID, monthly salary**, date joined) and a `shareholders` table (name, share %, shares held, share class).

**Remediation:** remove immediately, disable directory indexing, rotate any exposed credentials, store backups outside the web root and encrypted at rest, restrict access, add monitoring for exposed backup files.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>MED-03 · Weak PDF Password Protection</strong> — 🟠 High</summary>

All three retrieved lab reports (`patient_report_1/2/3.pdf`) were password-protected but crackable offline:

```
pdf2john patient_report_N.pdf > reportN.hash
hashcat -m 10500 reportN.hash rockyou.txt
```

All three passwords were recovered and independently verified via `pdftotext -upw`. Passwords, hashes, and file contents are **not published** in this repo (see [Evidence Handling](#-evidence-handling--privacy)).

**Remediation:** strong random secrets, application-level authorization instead of static PDF passwords, modern encryption with proper key management.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MED-04 · SQL Error Disclosure</strong> — 🟡 Medium</summary>

Malformed login input reflected raw MySQL/MariaDB error text, confirming unsafe SQL construction and assisting further exploitation.

**Remediation:** generic errors to users, verbose errors logged server-side only, disable debug/error display in production.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MED-05 · Username Enumeration</strong> — 🟢 Low</summary>

Distinct "username not found" vs. "incorrect password" responses allowed valid-account discovery.

**Remediation:** a single generic message — *"Invalid username or password."*
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MED-06 · Directory Listing</strong> — 🟢 Low</summary>

Indexing enabled on `/patient/`, `/staff/`, `/patient/reports/`, `/old/` — the latter directly exposing the leaked database backup.

**Remediation:** `Options -Indexes` (Apache) / equivalent LiteSpeed config; enforce authorization on sensitive directories.
</details>

## ⚠️ Overall Risk Assessment

<div align="center">

### **Overall Rating: CRITICAL**

</div>

Multiple vulnerabilities chain together into two serious compromise paths:

**Path A — Patient Data**
```
Internet → Public Web App → Patient Login → SQL Injection
   → Authentication Bypass → Restricted Patient Portal
   → Confidential Lab Reports → Offline PDF Password Recovery
   → Medical Information Disclosure
```

**Path B — Internal Records**
```
Internet → /old/ → Public Directory Listing
   → mediroza_db_backup_2019.sql → Internal Database Records
   → Employee Info · Salaries · National IDs · Shareholder Data
```

---

## 🔧 Recommendations & Remediation

### Priority 1 — Immediate
- Fix SQL injection with parameterized queries throughout
- Remove `/old/mediroza_db_backup_2019.sql` from the public web root
- Disable directory indexing site-wide
- Investigate whether exposed data was accessed by unauthorized parties

### Priority 2 — High
- Strengthen patient authentication (secure hashing, MFA, rate limiting, lockout, CSRF protection)
- Replace static PDF passwords with strong secrets + application-level authorization
- Remove verbose database error disclosure from production

### Priority 3 — Medium / Low
- Generic authentication error messages (prevent enumeration)
- Reduce technology/version disclosure (`X-Powered-By`, `Server`, CMS version)
- Implement security monitoring (failed logins, SQLi patterns, backup access)
- Store backups outside the web root, encrypted, access-restricted, periodically audited

## 💡 Lessons Learned

| # | Takeaway |
|---|---|
| 1 | Authentication must never trust client-supplied input |
| 2 | Verbose error messages are attacker intelligence, not just noise |
| 3 | `robots.txt` is not an access-control mechanism |
| 4 | Backups and legacy files are part of the attack surface |
| 5 | Encryption doesn't compensate for a weak password |
| 6 | Low-severity findings can chain into critical impact |
